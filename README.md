# Moho Documentation

Given that some documentation for Moho is hard to find, I have included it here for reference.

- [Moho 13 Users Manual](<docs/Moho 13 Users Manual.pdf>)
- [Moho 13 Changelog](<docs/Moho 13 Changelog.md>)
- [Anime Studio/Moho Document File Format Guide](docs/AnimeStudio-Moho-DocumentFileFormat.pdf)

Perhaps you're looking for a [Moho Project Template](https://github.com/definitelyokay/moho-template) that uses git for version control?
